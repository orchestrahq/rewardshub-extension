# RewardsHub Chrome Extension

RewardsHub is a Chrome extension that reminds you of benefits and offers that you're entitled to receive as a holder of particular credit cards. The extension works by automatically detecting the websites that you visit and checking whether your credit card provider has any live offers with that particular merchant.
